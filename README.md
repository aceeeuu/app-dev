## <p>**My Favorite Series** is <br> *Uncanny Counter*. </p>
### The Uncanny Counter (Korean: 경이로운 소문) is a South Korean television series starring Jo Byung-gyu, Yoo Jun-sang, Kim Se-jeong and Yeom Hye-ran. Based on the Daum webtoon Amazing Rumor by Jang Yi, it centers on the titular character So Mun, a high school student with disability who is enlisted to be part of the Counters, a group of paranormal-hunters who search for and fight against evil spirits that escape from the afterlife to prey on humans.
